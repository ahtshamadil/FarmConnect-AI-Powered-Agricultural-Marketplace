FarmConnect – AI-Powered Agricultural Marketplace
1. Introduction
Agriculture plays a vital role in Pakistan’s economy, yet small and medium farmers continue to face challenges such as lack of access to transparent market information, limited buyer reach, and price exploitation. The absence of a centralized, data-driven trading system leads to inefficiency and loss of farmer income.

FarmConnect is an AI-powered agricultural marketplace designed to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers. The platform provides real-time mandi price updates, AI-based price forecasts, and secure digital payments through Easypaisa and JazzCash. FarmConnect aims to establish a transparent, intelligent, and user-friendly digital ecosystem that empowers farmers and promotes fair trade.
